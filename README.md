# Social Circles

## üìñ Description
Hi, I'm Riyan, a CS undergrad at Princeton. This is a passion project I worked on with four other amazing engineers called Social Circles. Throughout my time at Princeton, I found that I didn‚Äôt feel as connected to the broader Princeton community, particularly with those from historically marginalized backgrounds. As I tried to get more involved, I realized that opportunities for meaningful engagement were scarce. To address this, I partnered with Dana Moorhead, a well-connected Princeton local, to create a platform that could bridge this gap and foster community connections.

Social Circles is an innovative web-based platform designed to support and connect historically marginalized communities in Princeton, New Jersey. Dana Moorhead, whose deep ties to the community inspire her work, currently reaches out to people directly‚Äîinviting them to free or low-cost events in arts, nature, and education through personal calls, texts, and emails. While effective, this method revealed the need for a centralized hub where people could easily access event information, resources, and community networks.

Our platform serves as a user-friendly web app where users can join communities based on shared interests and identities, register for events, and access curated resources. Social Circles also enhances efficiency by enabling Dana to communicate with the community on a larger scale, saving time while expanding her reach. This digital transformation ensures that Social Circles becomes a vital tool for fostering connections and promoting inclusivity in the Princeton community.---
